### Unknown, varying mean
For this, we need to know how the mean varies. Suppose we model this as
a linear regression model in $p$ known predictors:
$$Z(s_i) = \sum_{j=0}^p \beta_j X_j(s_i) + e(s_i)$$
$$Z(s) = \sum_{j=0}^p \beta_j X_j(s) + e(s) = X(s)\beta + e(s)$$
with $X(s)$ the matrix with predictors, 
and row $i$ and column $j$ containing $X_j(s_i)$, and with $\beta =
(\beta_0,...\beta_p)$. Usually, the first column of $X$ contains zeroes
in which case $\beta_0$ is an intercept.

Predictor: 
$$\hat{Z}(s_0) = x(s_0)\hat{\beta} + v'V^{-1} (Z-X\hat{\beta}) $$
with $x(s_0) = (X_0(s_0),...,X_p(s_0))$ and $\hat{\beta} = (X'V^{-1}X)^{-1} X'V^{-1}Z$
it has prediction error variance
$$\sigma^2(s_0) = \sigma^2_0 - v'V^{-1}v + Q$$ 
with $Q = (x(s_0) - X'V^{-1}v)'(X'V^{-1}X)^{-1}(x(s_0) - X'V^{-1}v)$

This form is called external drift kriging, universal kriging or sometimes
regression kriging.

Example in `meuse` data set: `log(zinc)` depending on
`sqrt(meuse)`

### Estimating spatial correlation under the UK model
As opposed to the ordinary kriging model, the universal kriging
model needs knowledge of the mean vector in order to estimate
the semivariance (or covariance) from the residual vector:
$$\hat{e}(s) = Z(s) - X\hat\beta$$
but how to get $\hat\beta$ without knowing $V$? This is a chicken-egg
problem. The simplest, but not best, solution is to plug $\hat{\beta}_{OLS}$
in, and from the $e_{OLS}(s)$, estimate $V$ (i.e., the variogram of $Z$)

### Spatial Prediction

... involves errors, uncertainties

### Kriging varieties
* Simple kriging: $Z(s)=\mu+e(s)$, $\mu$ known
* Ordinary kriging: $Z(s)=m+e(s)$, $m$ unknown
* Universal kriging: $Z(s)=X\beta+e(s)$, $\beta$ unknown
* SK: linear predictor $\lambda'Z$ with $\lambda$ such that
$\sigma^2(s_0) = \E(Z(s_0)-\lambda'Z)^2$ is minimized
* OK: linear predictor $\lambda'Z$ with $\lambda$ such that it
 * has minimum variance $\sigma^2(s_0) = \E(Z(s_0)-\lambda'Z)^2$, and
 * is unbiased $\E(\lambda'Z) = m$
* second constraint: $\sum_{i=1}^n \lambda_i = 1$, weights sum to one.

* UK:
$$\hat{Z}(s_0) = x(s_0)\hat{\beta} + v'V^{-1} (Z-X\hat{\beta}) $$
with $x(s_0) = (X_0(s_0),...,X_p(s_0))$ and $\hat{\beta} = (X'V^{-1}X)^{-1} X'V^{-1}Z$
$$\sigma^2(s_0) = \sigma^2_0 - v'V^{-1}v + Q$$ 
with $Q = (x(s_0) - X'V^{-1}v)'(X'V^{-1}X)^{-1}(x(s_0) - X'V^{-1}v)$
* OK: fill in a column vector with ones for $X$: $X=(1,1,...,1)'$ and $X_0=1$
* SK: take out the trend/unknown mean

### UK and linear regression
If $Z$ has no spatial correlation, all covariances are zero and
$v=0$ and $V=\mbox{diag}(\sigma^2)$. This implies that
$$\hat{Z}(s_0) = x(s_0)\hat{\beta} + v'V^{-1} (Z-X\hat{\beta}) $$
with $\hat{\beta} = (X'V^{-1}X)^{-1} X'V^{-1}Z$ reduces to

$$\hat{Z}(s_0) = x(s_0)\hat{\beta}$$
with $\hat{\beta} = (X'X)^{-1} X'Z$, i.e., ordinary least squares regression.

Note that
* under this model
the residual does not carry information, as it is white noise
* in spatial prediction, UK can not be worse than linear regression,
as linear regression is a limiting case of a more general model.

### Global vs. local predictors
In many cases, instead of using all data, the number of observations used for
prediction are limited to a selection of nearest observations, based on
* number of observations or
* distance to prediction location $s_0$
* possibly, in addition, directions
The reason for this is usually either
* statistical, allowing for a more flexible mean/trend structure
* practical, if $n$ gets large

### Statistical arguments for local prediction
* estimating $\beta$ locally instead of globally means that
 * $\beta$ will adjust to local situations (less bias)
 * it will be harder to estimate $\beta$ from less information, so
   (slightly?) larger prediction errors will result (larger variance)
 * $X$ needs to be non-singular in every neighbourhood
* some authors claim that local trends are so
 adaptive, that one can ignore spatial correlation of the residual
* Using local linear regression with {\em weights} that decay
 with distance is called {\em geographically weighted regression}, GWR

### Practical arguments for local prediction
* The number of observations, $n$ may become very large.
 * lidar data, 3D chemical, satellite sensors, geotechnical, seismic, ...
* Computing $V^{-1}v$ is the expensive part; it is $O(N^2)$  or $O(N^3)$ as $V$
is usually not of simple structure
* there is a trade-off; for a global neighbourhood, the expensive part, 
factoring $V$ needs only be done once, for a local neighbourhood for 
each unique neighbourhood (in practice: for each $s_0$).
* selecting local neighbourhoods also costs time; naive selection
$O(n \log n)$ doesn't scale well
* \code{gstat} uses quadtrees/octtrees, inspired by
http://donar.umiacs.umd.edu/quadtree/index.html

### Predicting block means
Instead of predicting $Z(s_0)$ for a ``point'' location, one might be
interested at predicting the average of $Z(s)$ over a block, $B_0$, i.e.
$$Z(B_0) = \frac{1}{|B_0|}\int_{B_0} Z(u)du$$
* This can (naively) be done by predicting $Z$ over a large number of points
$s_0$ inside $B_0$, and averaging
* For the prediction {\em error}, of $\hat{Z}(B_0)$, we then need the
covariances between all point predictions
* a more efficient way is to use block kriging, which does both at once

### Reason why one wants block means
Examples
* mining: we cannot mine point values
* soil remediation: we cannot remediate points
* RS: we can match satellite image pixels
* disaster management: we cannot evacuate points
* environment: legislation may be related to blocks
* accuracy: block means can be estimated with smaller
errors than points

### cokriging
Cokriging sets the multivariate equivalent of kriging, which is, in
terms of number of dependent variables, univariate. Kriging:
$$Z(s) = X(s)\beta + e(s)$$
Cokriging:
$$Z_1(s) = X_1(s)\beta_1 + e_1(s)$$
$$Z_2(s) = X_2(s)\beta_2 + e_2(s)$$
$$Z_k(s) = X_k(s)\beta_k + e_k(s)$$
with $V = \Cov(e_1,e_2,...,e_k)$


Cases where this is useful: multiple spatial correlated variables such as
* chemical properties (auto-analyzers!)
* sediment composition
* electromagnetic spectra (imagery/remote sensing)
* ecological data (abiotic factors; species abundances)
* (space-time data, with discrete time)
Two types of applications:
* undersampled case: secondary variables help prediction
of a primary, because we have more samples of them (image?)
* equally sampled case: secondary variables don't help
prediction much, but we are interested in {\em multivariate
prediction}, i.e. prediction error covariances.

### Cokriging prediction
Cokriging prediction is not substantially different from kriging
prediction, it is just a lot of book-keeping.

How to set up Z(s), X, beta, e(s), x(s_0), v, V?

Multivariable prediction involves the joint prediction of multiple,
both spatially and cross-variable correlated variables.  Consider $m$
distinct variables, and let
$\{Z_i(s), X_i, \beta^i, e_i(s), x_i(s_0), v_i, V_i\}$ 
correspond to 
$\{Z(s), X, \beta, e(s), x(s_0), v, V\}$ of the $i$-th variable. Next, let
${\bf Z}(s) = (Z_1(s)',...,Z_m(s)')'$, 
${\bf B}=({\beta^1} ',...,{\beta^m} ')'$,
${\bf e}(s)=(e_1(s)',...,e_m(s)')'$,

$$
{\bf X} =
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
X_1 & 0 & ... & 0 \\\\
0 & X_2 & ... & 0 \\\\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\\\
0 & 0 & ... & X_m \\\\
\end{array}
\right], \
{\bf x}(s_0) =
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
x_1(s_0) & 0 & ... & 0 \\\\
0 & x_2(s_0) & ... & 0 \\\\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\\\
0 & 0 & ... & x_m(s_0) \\\\
\end{array}
\right]
$$

with $0$ conforming zero matrices, and

$${\bf v} =
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
v_{1,1} & v_{1,2} & ... & v_{1,m} \\\\
v_{2,1} & v_{2,2} & ... & v_{2,m} \\\\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\\\
v_{m,1} & v_{m,2} & ... & v_{m,m} \\\\
\end{array}
\right], \ \ 
{\bf V} =
\left[
\begin{array}{cccc}
V_{1,1} & V_{1,2} & ... & V_{1,m} \\\\
V_{2,1} & V_{2,2} & ... & V_{2,m} \\\\
\vdots & \vdots & \ddots & \vdots \\\\
V_{m,1} & V_{m,2} & ... & V_{m,m} \\\\
\end{array}
\right]
$$

where element $i$ of $v_{k,l}$ is $\Cov(Z_k(s_i), Z_l(s_0))$, and where
element $(i,j)$ of $V_{k,l}$ is $\Cov(Z_k(s_i),Z_l(s_j))$.

The multivariable prediction equations equal the previous UK equations and
when all matrices are substituted by their multivariable
forms (see also Ver Hoef and Cressie, Math.Geol., 1993), and when for 
$\sigma^2_0$, $\Sigma$ is substituted with $\Cov(Z_i(s_0),Z_j(s_0))$
in its $(i,j)$-th element. Note that the prediction variance
is now a prediction error covariance matrix.

### What is needed?
The main tool for estimating semivariances between different variables
is the {\em cross variogram}, defined for collocated data as
$$\gamma_{ij}(h) = \mbox{E}[(Z_i(s)-Z_i(s+h))(Z_j(s)-Z_j(s+h))]$$
and for non-collocated data as
$$\gamma_{ij}(h) = \mbox{E}[(Z_i(s)-m_i)(Z_j(s)-m_j)]$$
with $m_i$ and $m_j$ the means of the respective variables. Sample cross
variograms are the obvious sums over the available pairs or cross pairs,
as in one of
$$\hat{\gamma}_{jk}(\tilde{h})=\frac{1}{N_h}\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}(Z_j(s_i)-Z_j(s_i+h))(Z_k(s_i)-Z_k(s_i+h))$$
$$\hat{\gamma}_{jk}(\tilde{h})=\frac{1}{N_h}\sum_{i=1}^{N_h}(Z_j(s_i)-m_j)(Z_k(s_i+h)-m_k)$$

### Permissible cross covariance functions
Two classes of permissible cross covariance (semivariance) functions
are often used:
* intrinsic correlation (IC): 
$$\gamma_{jk}(h) = \alpha_{jk} \sqrt{\gamma_{jj}(h)\gamma_{kk}(h)}$$
parameters $\alpha_{jk}$ are correlation cofficients; very strict
* linear model of coregionalization (LMC): 
$$\gamma_{jk}(h) = \sum_{l=1}^p \gamma_{jk,p}(h)$$ (e.g., nugget + spherical model), and
$$\gamma_{jk,p}(h) = \alpha_{jk,p} \sqrt{\gamma_{jj,p}(h)\gamma_{kk,p}(h)}$$

### How to do this?
As multivariable analysis may involve numerous variables, we need to
start organising the available information. For that reason, we collect all the
observation data specifications in a \code{gstat} object, created by
the function \code{gstat}. This function does nothing else than ordering
(and actually, copying) information needed later in a single object.
Consider the following definitions of four heavy metals:

```{r}
library(sp)
data(meuse)
coordinates(meuse) = ~x+y
library(gstat)
g <- gstat(NULL, "logCd", log(cadmium)~1, meuse)
g <- gstat(g, "logCu", log(copper)~1, meuse)
g <- gstat(g, "logPb", log(lead)~1, meuse)
g <- gstat(g, "logZn", log(zinc)~1, meuse)
g 
vm <- variogram(g)
vm.fit <- fit.lmc(vm, g, vgm(1, "Sph", 800, 1))
plot(vm, vm.fit)
```

### Kriging predictions and errors -- how good are they?
Cross validation can be used to assess the quality of any interpolation,
including kriging. We split the data set in $n$ parts (folds). For each part, we
* leave out the observations of this fold
* use the observations of all other folds to predict the values at the
locations of this fold
* compare the predictions with the observations
This is called $n$-fold cross validation. If $n$ equals the number of
observation, it is called leave-one-out cross validation (LOOCV).

### Cross validation: what does it yield?
* residuals $r(s_i) = z(s_i) -\hat{z}(s_i)$ -- histograms, maps, summary statistics
* mean residual should be near zero
* mean square residual $\sum r(s_i)^2$ should be as small as possible

In case the interpolation method yields a prediction error we can
compute z-scores: $r(s_i)/\sigma(s_i)$

The z-score allows the validation of the kriging error, as the z-score
should have mean close to zero and variance close to 1. If the variance
of the z-score is larger (smaller) than 1, the kriging standard error is
underestimating (overestimating) the true interpolation error, on average.

### Kriging errors -- what do they mean?
Suppose legislation prescribes remediation in case zinc exceeds 500 ppm.
Where does the zinc level exceed 500 ppm?

* we can compare the map of the predictions with 500. However:
 * $\hat{z}(s_0)$ does not equal $z(s_0)$:
 * $\hat{z}(s_0)$ is more smooth than $z(s_0)$
 * $\hat{z}(s_0)$ is closer to the mean than $z(s_0)$
 * smoothing effect is stronger if spatial correlation is small or
 nugget effect is relatively large
* alternatively we can assume that the true (unknown) value follows
a probability distribution, with mean $\hat{z}(s_0)$ and standard error
$\sigma(s_0)$.
* this latter approach acknowledges that $\sigma(s_0)$ is useful as
a measure of interpolation accuracy

### Conditional probability
* we can use e.g. the normal distribution (on the log-scale?) to 
assess the conditional probability $\Pr(Z(s_0) > 500 | z(s_1),...,z(s_n))$

* the additional assumption underlying this is {\em multivariate
normality}: in addition to having stationary mean and covariance, the
field $Z$ is now assumed to follow a stationary, multivariate normal
distribution. This means that any single $Z(s_i)$ follows a normal
distribution, and any pair $Z(s_i), Z(s_j)$ follows a bivariate normal
distribution, with known variances and covariance.

How?
```{r}
out = krige(log(zinc)~1, meuse, meuse.grid, v.fit)
out$p500 = 1 - pnorm(log(500), out$var1.pred, sqrt(out$var1.var))
spplot(out["p500"], col.regions = bpy.colors())
```
